# Project Euler Solutions

Welcome to the repository of solutions for Project Euler problems, implemented in C.

## About

This repository contains implementations for solving various Project Euler problems. Each problem is organized in its own directory with solutions provided in C.

## Directory Structure

The directory structure is organized as follows:

```
problems/
├── 001/
│   ├── csolution.c
│   └── readme.md
├── 002/
│   ├── csolution.c
│   └── readme.md
└── ...
```

- `problems/`: Contains directories for each problem.
- `001/`, `002/`, etc.: Directories for specific problems.
- `csolution.c`: C solution for the problem.
- `readme.md`: Description of the problem.

### Usage Instructions Compiling and Running C Solutions

1. Navigate to the problem directory:

   ```sh
   cd problems/001
   ```

2. Compile the C code:

   ```sh
   gcc -o solution csolution.c
   ```

3. Run the compiled program:

   ```sh
   ./csolution
   ```
